# Our progress
We spent a lot of time on the lecture materials trying to learn as much as we could before starting the assignment. This part was a little overwhelming and took a little more time than anticipated, but in the end we had to move on to working through the problems

All solutions are stored in the solutions directory. We were able to complete some of the problems, but not as many as we hoped since we felt a little out of our element on these subjects. Hoping to revisit these problems in the future as time allows
